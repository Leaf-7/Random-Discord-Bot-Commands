# Random Discord Bot Commands
This is a list of commands that I made for my discord bot (atm just one), using Node.JS! (I'm still quite new to Node.JS)
## Fetch Minecraft Server Status:
Fetches the status of a Minecraft server. Fetches the Ip address, Motd, Player count, Player names (where possible) and version number. Command: `/fetch ip:<Enter IP Address>`. 

NOTE 1: In fetch.js, replace `<Insert File Path of 'index.js'>` with the path of index.js.

NOTE 2: Place fetch.js in the commands folder.

Note 3: You muct have `node-fecth@2` library for index.js.
