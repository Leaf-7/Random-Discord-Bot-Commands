# Random Discord Bot Commands
This is a list of commands that I made for my discord bot, using Node.JS! This presumes you already have prior knowledge on `discord.js`! (I'm still quite new to Node.JS) (I'm doing this just for fun, don't expect me to actively maintain this!)

This uses the `Discord.js` Library
