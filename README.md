# Random Discord Bot Commands
This is a list of commands that I made for my discord bot, using Node.JS! (I'm still quite new to Node.JS)
## Fetch Minecraft Server Status:
Fetches the status of a Minecraft server. Fetches the Ip address, Motd, Player count, Player names (where possible) and version number. Command: `/fetch ip:<Enter IP Address>`.
